 # APIs Used
 * [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/).
 * [coronavirus-tracker-api](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api)
 
 ## Note
  * [coronavirus-tracker-api](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api) is an opensource community managed API
  so it is more likely to happen that the project might get deleted or may no longer managed by community, So in future this application 
  may not work without this API ( but I will update (if any available) the API ASAP if something happens ). 
  * if every things goes fine app will update after every 12 hours.
  * [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) API is on free subscription which has 1,000 calls/day and 60 calls/min so this could also happen that app might not show any data for a while if API call limit exceeds.
  
## Installation
* You can clone the repo (Before start using the code please concider changing the api key of OpenWeather with your own), compile and run it by your self if not

## About This Application
Idea of this application was originnaly came from a redit user (who created a live Corona update display using an raspberry pi
and a simple LCD which was cool ), he also provided the API that he used for resberry project so thants for that.
And thanks to contributers of [Corona API](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api).
